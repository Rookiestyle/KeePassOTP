In the database-specific area you can choose the working mode of KeePassOTP.

The general area lets you define settings that are valid for all databases.

## Usage

OTP settings are entry-specific.
To setup, change, copy or auto-type the OTP, you may use the context menu of the respective entry.

If you're interested in migration instructions to move from (or to) other OTP plugins or if you want to know more about some of the technical details, please have a look at the [Wiki](https://github.com/rookiestyle/keepassotp/wiki).

### Setup OTP data / Change OTP data

Use the entry's context menu to setup/change OTP data.

In the setup form, you can drag&drop the QR code image onto the QR picture in the setup form and have KeePassOTP parse it or you can enter the OTP secret manually (sometimes referred to as a seed) and you're ready to go.

In addition, you can click the screen capture button and KeePassOTP will search for an OTP QR code anywhere on the screen.

Got a string like this one?

```
otpauth://totp/Example:alice@google.com?secret=JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP&issuer=Example
```

Paste the entire string, KeePassOTP can process this [otpauth-format](https://github.com/google/google-authenticator/wiki/Key-Uri-Format) as well.

As almost all sites require you to enter an OTP as part of the activation process, both current and next OTP are displayed here as well.
